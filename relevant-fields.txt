# Relevant Fields
23: Breed Type

# Potentially Relevant Fields 
49: Sex -- if we can figure out how to encode
52: Sire -- if we can encode
54: Dam -- if we can encode
56: Breeder -- if encodable (probably not)

# Definitely Relevant Fields that we should figure out an encoding for
306-315: Track condition (Past 10) -- need to encode
326-335: Surface (Past 10) -- need to encode


# Future Fields to Derive
29-32: Trainer Stats 
33,35-38: Jockey Stats
65-69 (ayyyy): Horse Stats at today's distance
70-74: Horse record at today's track
75-79: Horse Turf Record
80-84: Horse Wet Record
85-90: Horse Latest Year Record -- could feed lastest year win %
91-96: Horse Previous Year Record -- could feed last year win % 
97-101: Horse Lifetime Record
1178: Best TSN Speed - Fast Track
1179: Best TSN Speed - Turf
1180: Best TSN Speed - Off Track
1181: Best TSN Speed - Distance


Notes:
We can probably encode the 'Surface' by finding the Best TSN Speed for that surface
and then filling in those values for the past races depending on what type of surface
they were on. The same should be done for distance.

We can also potentially encode the 'Track Condition' by deriving the number of lifetime starts, wins, places, etcs
for a horse during any particular condition. Not sure if this data exists though.
